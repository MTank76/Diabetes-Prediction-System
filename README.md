# Diabetes Prediction System

This repository contains a hobby project focused on data analysis and machine learning for predicting diabetes using the Prima Indian Diabetes dataset from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The project is based on Jupyter Notebooks and aims to explore data analysis and create a machine learning model for diabetes prediction.

## Dataset

The Prima Indian Diabetes dataset used in this project can be found on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MTank76/Diabetes-Prediction-System). The dataset includes various parameters such as Body Mass Index (BMI), insulin levels, and others to predict the presence of diabetes in individuals.

## Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is:

- **Diabetes Prediction:** Utilize machine learning techniques to predict whether an individual has diabetes based on available parameters.
- **Insights and Analysis:** Explore insights from the data to understand correlations and dependencies, identifying which parameters influence diabetes prediction the most.

## Project Structure

The project notebook is divided into two main sections:

### Data Science

- **Data Exploration:** Analysis of the dataset, including statistical summaries, data visualization, and insights into key features.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, scaling, and encoding categorical variables for model preparation.

### Machine Learning

- **Model Building:** Training various machine learning models using the prepared dataset.
- **Model Evaluation:** Performance evaluation of models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Feature Importance:** Determining the most influential parameters in predicting diabetes.

## How to Access the Project
